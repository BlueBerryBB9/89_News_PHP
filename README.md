# Ecole 89 News project

## Context :
This project happened during a web development beginner school class to teach us HTML and CSS while challenging us with the split scrolling mecanism (when only one part of the website is scrolling down).
The goal was to reproduce [this mockup](image_2024-06-26_184428196.png).

## Here are all the different pages of the website

###### you can see the use of asplit scrolling on the main page
